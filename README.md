# P46_Mycelium_Model
Mycelium simulation by Owen Read and Zahra Motlekar.

The aim of this program is to simulate the stochastic growth of mycelium within a substrate bed. This program serves as a first attempt to create a model that will accuratelty determine the performance of a Solid State Fermentation (SSF) Reactor such that metrics like total biomass production and time until substrate colonisation is achieved can be predicted.
 
To run the simulation:
1. Download the zip file containing the program files and unzip the contents.
2. Change directory to the newly unzipped folder.
3. run the window.py file. This may be achieved by running:
   python3 window.py


Required Libraries:
- pygame
- moviepy
- pillow
- xlsxwriter
- numpy
- os
- math
- sys
- random
